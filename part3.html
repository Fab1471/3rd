    <h1>Part 3: A Moment I'll Never Forget…</h1>
    <p>
        I still smile when I remember that video your friend took, your reaction when I said "Gihigugma tika" during our video call.<br><br>
        The pure joy on your face… it was beautiful, Kathlyn.<br><br>
        That moment, and so many others – like the wonder in your eyes when you saw that owl, or even just knowing you carry that little piece of "Fabri" with you in that keychain you bought on your trip – they're all etched in my heart.<br><br>
        They remind me of how real and special our connection is, even across the miles.<br><br>
        Seeing you happy makes me the happiest "idiota apaixonado" in the world.<br><br>
        Get ready, my love, because the next part holds a little letter where I attempt to capture in words just how much you mean to me…
